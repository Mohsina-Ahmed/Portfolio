Here's an example

#### Programming Languages

Throughout my career, I have honed a wide range of technical skills, including proficiency in programming languages such as HTML5/CSS3, C/C++/C#, ASP.NET, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python3, and Ruby. I am well-versed in web application architecture, utilizing tools like Apache/WAMP, and some frameworks like CodeIgniter and Flask. My experience also encompasses Content Management Systems like WordPress and Source Code Management using GitHub.

#### Modern Software Development Tools

My recent engagement in the Software Engineering Programme has further expanded my skill set. Through this program, I have learned to apply, and explain the purpose of, four key engineering practices: test-driven development, program design, debugging, and pair programming. My proficiency in TDD is underscored by my adept use of 'pytest' for Python applications and the design of comprehensive README.md files for various programs. Moreover, I have embraced debugging strategies and adopted agile methodologies like the Navigator and Driver approach for pair programming, fostering an ethos of systematic design within larger systems. All these makes software development a very mythological approach. This modern approach of development provides awareness of the problems that we may to have investigate in future and give us an understanding of the level of the problem. I am also delving into Cloud Engineering, mastering concepts like containerization, CI/CD, orchestration, and securing cloud applications.

#### Web Development

In my first job as an ICT officer and course co-ordinator in a private medical company, I have worked under a senior web developer, that gives me a good practical knowledge of working in a website and to deploy in the live server. The whole process of uploading while helping to solve different errors always gives you better understanding. To help survive the company in pandemic, we have designed some e-learning projects that’s again prove that my goal is to always support the company and working towards its welfare. We have designed online marking portal for life support courses
